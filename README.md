# HuffmanZipper
Huffman Coding is an efÔ¨Åcient method of lossless compression that assigns variable-length to characters based on their frequency. This is a C++ compression and decompression program based on Huffman Coding. I did not use STL's std::priority_queue, and instead have written my own based on binary heap. I did not bother with gui, and it is very simple.
